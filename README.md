### Source code: src/main/java/org/example
This Movie Database Application is a comprehensive, Java-based program designed to handle movie, series, and actor data. The system allows different types of users, including admins, contributors, and regular users, to manage, interact with, and enjoy a vast collection of movies and series. Admins have full control, with privileges to manage content and users, while contributors can add new entries, update existing ones, and interact with the data. Regular users can leave comments, rate content, add movies or series to their favorites, and receive notifications for updates and new content. The system also allows users to leave comments on specific movies or series, enhancing user engagement and promoting community interaction. Notifications are available to users for updates on new content, responses to their comments, or recommendations based on their preferences. A crucial feature of the application is its ability to categorize and store data about actors, linking them to the movies and series they participate in. This allows users to explore an actorâ€™s full filmography, adding more context and value to their experience. The database structure is designed to store all necessary information, including user data, content, comments, and favorite lists, enabling a seamless user experience.
